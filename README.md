# FIFA-19-Players-and-their-Attribute-Analysis
Information Visualization (IST 719) Final Project and Poster

**Introduction**

Being an avid supporter and follower of European soccer, I decided to work with a European soccer related dataset. The name of the dataset is FIFA 19 Complete Player Dataset. The dataset is scraped from https://sofifa.com/ and is present in Kaggle. It contains 18207 rows with 89 columns. The columns are present in numerical character formats. Columns such as Name, Nationality, Club Name, Position and Work rate are present in character format whereas the rest of the columns such as age, overall rating, potential, different attributes etc are present in numerical format. The dataset contains detailed attributes for every player in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.

**Data Story:**

The story of the data is disruptive. As the dataset is massive, each attribute leads us to several new questions. For example, I could think about questions like, ‘What factors affects the wages of players in the dataset?’ or ‘Does skills and abilities decline with age?’. After looking at the data, the question which came in my mind is, “Who are the best Players in each position with respect to skills and abilities playing across Europe?”. This question leads to other questions such as: “Are the skills and abilities of a forward player same as that of a midfielder or a defender?” and “What are the dominant attributes which makes a player best in all the positions?”.
There are lot of controversies regarding the best players in each position across the leagues in Europe. The statistics doesn’t always say the true story because soccer is not played on pen and paper. So, this question is an interesting as well as a controversial one.
